1,matrescence,matrescence.mp4,Matrescence,"An experience, not the experience.","A heading ""Matrescence"" fades in. Blue lines of thread draw themselves across a purple background one at a time, like a curve in a line chart. The text ""There are as many experiences of becoming a mother as there are mothers in this world."" appears and then fades away. A light purple line of thread draws itself across the screen. The text ""This project is about mine"" appears. The line above starts with a big dip, then bumpily rises upwards. An annotation saying ""Our dog died when I was pregnant..."" is shown at the top of the big dip in the line. The next dip is annotated ""My newborn dropped from the 50th to the 3rd percentile..."". The next rise is annotated ""Starting to get the hang of things..."". The line finishes at a high point and the final annotation reads ""...and getting better at rolling with the punches.""",dark-mode
